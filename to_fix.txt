To do:
/- fix underline in menu item - done // getBoundingClientRect changed to offsetLeft (probably unnecessary - error was because of style/js loading order) //
/- fix width of underline at start / width 40 should be 46 / - done //  js was loading before css. Adding window.onload into DOMContentLoaded fixed the problem //
